Scaling simplifies an expression that describe a process by: elimination of terms deemed insignificant and units, 
and reducing magnitude to O(1).  Robust scales enable prediction, and parametrization of one set of phenomena 
in models whose focus is of a different scale.  Scales of the lower Convective Boundary Layer are well known.  Much work has been done on those of the Entrainment Zone 
but it does not seem to have been as yet organized in the form of a scaling diagram.

\section{Scales of the Convective Boundary Layer}
\label{sec:ScalesoftheConnvectiveBoundaryLayer}

Under certain sets of conditions The Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) exhibits predictable behaviour.  
Key variables can be identified from which dimensionless groups and scales are formed, and parametrizations derived.  One of such, the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL), is known to be driven by convection resulting from 
surface heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$).  It has a time varying height (h) at which turbulent
kinetic energy (TKE), and tracer concentration (c) sharply decreases and potential temperature ($\theta$)
increases to that of the stable layer above.  Growth is driven by $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ and 
impeded by the stable lapse rate ($\gamma$) above  or the potential temperature inversion jump ($\Delta \theta$).  $\Delta \theta$ is effectively strengthened
by subsidence $W_{L}$ under anticyclonic conditions; warm dry air advects downwards, reducing cloud formation
and clearing the way for solar radiation.

\subsection{Surface Similarity: from $Ri_{f}$ to $-\frac{z}{L}$}
\label{subsec:MoninObukhovLength}
The surface layer is usually defined as the layer where fluxes vary less than 10 percent of their 
magnitude with height.  So, variables are simplified by representing them at one height - the surface ($z_{0}$).
Here the TKE is from both convection and shear.  The Flux Richardson number, $Ri_{f}$ is obtained by taking the buoyancy term over the negative of the shear 
term from the TKE equation:\\

\begin{equation}
R_{f} = \frac{\left({\frac{g}{\overline{\theta_{v}}}} \right) \left(\overline{w^{'}\theta_{v}^{'}} \right)}{ \left(\overline{u_{i}^{'}u_{j}^{'}} \right) \frac{\partial \overline{U_{i}}}{\partial x_{j}}} \\
\end{equation}

Assuming horizontal homogeneity and ignoring the large scale vertical motions this is reduced to:\\

\begin{equation}
R_{f} = \frac{\left({\frac{g}{\overline{\theta_{v}}}} \right) \left(\overline{w^{'}\theta_{v}^{'}} \right)}{ \left(\overline{u^{,}w^{'}} \right) 
\frac{\partial \overline{U}}{\partial z} + \left(\overline{v^{'}w^{'}} \right) \frac{\partial \overline{V}}{\partial z}} \\
\end{equation}

In the surface layer the shear and stability terms can be nondimentionalized:\\

\begin{equation}
\psi_{M} = \frac{\partial M}{\partial z}\frac{kz}{u_{*}}, \psi_{H} = \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z}\frac{kz}{\theta_{*}}\\
\end{equation}

and $\psi_{M} = 1$.  First order closure gives:\\

$\left( \overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}} \right) = K_{H} \frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z} = u_{*} \theta_{*}$ 
and $\left( \overline{w^{'} u^{'}} \right) = K_{M} \frac{\partial M}{\partial z} = u_{*}^{2}$\\

This scaling is applied to the denominator of $Ri_{f}$ giving

\begin{equation}
\frac{\left({\frac{g}{\overline{\theta_{v}}}} \right) \left(\overline{w^{'}\theta_{v}^{'}} \right)}{u_{*}^{2}  \frac{\partial \overline{M}}{\partial z}}\\
\end{equation}

and the wind shear is exchanged with its dimensionless form above.  Rearranging gives\\

\begin{equation}
z \left( \frac{kg \left( \overline{w^{'} \theta^{'}} \right) }{\overline{\theta} u_{*}^{3}} \right) = -\frac{z}{L} = \xi      
\end{equation}

a commonly used dimensionless stability parameter for the neutral surface layer.%does this apply to the CBL.

\subsection{A Scaling Diagram for the Convective Boundary Layer}

In the lower CBL, L becomes small as convective turbulence dominates and is influenced more by the surface than the inversion.  Local free convection scales become important.  In the Mixed Layer (ML) convective turbulence is driven by the surface heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{0}$) and is impeded by the inversion or stable lapse rate at h. The ML temperature approaches a uniform, increasing value.   
\cite{Stull-BLMetIntro}\\

Scales for these three CBL regions are concisely represented over a typical range of $-\frac{h}{L}$ in \citeauthor{HoltNieu86}'s scaling diagram 
(\autoref{fig:Scaledi}).  A free convection layer begins to form when $-\frac{h}{L} > 10$ and dominates the surface layer when $-\frac{h}{L} \ge 100$.  
At the time of 
publication little was known of the scales above the convective ML so the authors assigned to the Entrainment Zone a constant scaled depth of 
0.4h.  But, for example, at the onset of significant convection the entire initial CBL could be considered an Entrainment Zone. So, a constant scaled depth 
with respect to time may not be representative.
%(need to ask about Rolands use of a local $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ as opposed to the surface value in the diagram)

\label{sec:ScalesfortheEntrainmnetZone}

\subsection{Convective Boundary Layer Entrainment}
\label{subsec:ConvectiveBoundaryLayerEntrainment}

A turbulent fluid will entrain an adjoining or surrounding less turbulent fluid and the mean velocity at which the less turbulent fluid flows in is assumed proportional to a characteristic velocity of the turbulent region.  The entrainment velocity is then either: the rate at which the non turbulent fluid flows in or the rate at which the turbulent fluid expands.\\   

The principal vehicles for turbulence in the CBL are buoyant thermals or plumes and they act against an inversion or stable lapse rate. In \cite{Turner86} \citeauthor{Turner86} draws a distinction between how surrounding air is mixed into thermals vs plumes and argues that in case of thermals it depends on the overall dynamics rather than turbulent velocity or length scales. Nonetheless he states estimates for the rise heights of both plumes and thermals in terms of their initial buoyancy and the stability against which they act.\\ 

The CBL plumes or thermals rise, mixing surrounding air and expanding. They rise until their density is equal to or exceeds that of the surroundings. The plume then spreads, or overshoots and sinks with oscillation characterized by the Brunt Vasalla frequency $N = \sqrt{\frac{g}{\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dz}}$. Sinking can occur by convective overturning or recoil when $\Delta \theta$ or $\gamma$ is large.  Thus air from aloft is engulfed or trapped (entrained) and further mixing occurs at smaller scales.  Under these conditions the general consensus is that entrainment at the level of viscosity is unimportant. If there is no penetration of the layer above and the air reaches its density level unimpeded, this is considered encroachment rather than entrainment.\\ 
\cite{Turner86}

\subsection{Boundary Layer Growth (Entrainment) Rate $W_{e}$}
\label{subsec:BoundaryLayerGrowth}

The CBL grows via thermals or plumes impinging upon the stable air aloft and entraining it. In line with the above the overall entrainment velocity  is its increase in height less large scale vertical motion IE subsidence under anticyclonic conditions.

\begin{equation}
W_{e} = \frac{dh}{dt} - W_{L}  
\end{equation}

The speed at which the CBL advances vertically is proportional to the surface heat flux and inversely proportional to the inversion strength (or stability above).

\begin{equation}
W_{e} \propto \frac{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}}{\Delta \theta}  
\end{equation}
\cite{Deardorff79}
When scaled by a characteristic velocity which in our case is the convective velocity scale: 

\begin{equation}
W^{*} = \left( B h \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}  
= \left( \frac{g}{\overline{\theta}} h \overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}_{s}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\end{equation}

This expression assumes the following form

\begin{equation}
\frac{W_{e}}{W^{*}} \propto Ri^{*a}  
\end{equation}

where $Ri^{*} = \frac{g}{\overline{\theta}} \Delta \theta \frac{h}{w^{*2}}$ is a buoyancy Richardson Number. a is usually $-1$ but sometimes $-\frac{3}{2}$ as summarized by \citeauthor{Turner86} when $\frac{LN}{U}$ in our case $\frac{hN}{W^{*}}$ becomes sufficiently large (eg $\approx 6$) \cite{Turner86}.
\\

Alternatively $S = \frac{g}{\overline{\theta}} \gamma \frac{h^{2}}{w^{*2}}$,  the square of the ratio of the convective time scale to the Brunt Vasalla time scale, is used. \cite{Deardorff79}  Both are applicable in experiments where a constant $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ acts against a stable $\gamma$ producing a convective turbulent ML capped by a $\Delta \theta$ \cite{Turner86}. It follows that $\Delta \theta$ must be a function of $\gamma$ and $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$.\\
%the last reference to Turner may actually be a reference to a Deardorff study.
\subsection{What is the Entrainment Zone?}

  \caption{CBL $\theta$ Profile \cite{Stull-BLMetIntro}}
  \label{fig:BLPotTemp}
\end{wrapfigure}

In terms of an average or idealized $\theta$ (or c profile) if h is the point at which the gradient is maximum, then the Entrainment Zone (EZ)
can be defined as the region bounded by the points at which; the profiles first deviate from the ML value, and resume the Free Atmospheric (FA) value.\\

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}

    \end{center}
    \caption{CBL Flux Profile \cite{Stull-BLMetIntro}}
    \label{fig:CBLFluxProf}   % label should change
\end{wrapfigure}

The $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profile crosses zero, reaches a minimum (maximum negative) value and increases to zero again bounding a region of overall heating from above which also can be regarded as the EZ.\\

Since the CBL is composed of buoyant plumes (or thermals) the top of the EZ can be defined at the tops of the highest but the bottom is not so clear from this perspective.  It's often defined as the level at which a high percentage of air is Free Atmosphere (FA) air. \cite{StullNelEl} \\

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    % For the sake of this example, we'll just use text
    \includegraphics[scale=.5]{pngs/ELStull_Plumes}
    \caption{CBL Plume Tops \cite{StullNelEl}}
    \label{fig:CBLPlumTops}   % label should change
\end{figure}


The degree to which (the highest) CBL plumes overshoot the top of the ML (or the bottom of the EZ) is obviously related to the buoyant momentum and inversely related to the FA $\gamma$ or $\Delta \theta$.  So a relationship to the buoyancy Richardson Number ($Ri^{*}$) and scaled $W_{e}$ follows, where suggested values for b  are  $-\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{4}$ \cite{StullNelEl}.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta h}{h} \propto Ri^{* b} \propto \frac{W_{e}}{W_{*}}  
\end{equation}  

Clearly the h and $\Delta h$ based on the average $\theta$ profile is related to the distribution of local h values. So characteristics of the distribution should relate to $Ri^{*}$ \cite{SullMoengStev}, \cite{BrooksFowler2}.  

\section{Research Goals}
\label{sec:ResearchGoals}

The LES studies of \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev}, \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04} and more recently \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} in \cite{BrooksFowler2} were carried out on grids of lower resolution than those which began to converge in \citeauthor{SullPat} \cite{SullPat}, except for the cases specifically for testing resolution effects. \citeauthor{SullPat} \cite{SullPat} influenced our choice of grid size, in particular within the \acs{EL}\\

 All of these were carried out on $5 \times 5 km$ domains and used a combination of both time and spatial averaging to obtain average profiles.  So far, we haven't seen a study involving an ensemble of cases, such that true ensemble averaging can be carried out.  We chose this setup to obtain true ensemble averages, and to have a wealth of local points for some basic statistical observations.\\

\citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04} varied their cases by upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) over a typical range found in the troposphere IE $1 - 10 K / Km$, whereas \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev} and \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} in \cite{BrooksFowler2} varied surface heat flux and initial inversion ($\Delta \theta$).  To obtain a range of Richardson numbers (\acs{Ri}) we varied both surface heat flux ($w^{'}\theta^{'}$) and upper lapse rate ($\gamma$).\\

\subsection{Verifying that the Model output is realistic}

Since unlike the other LES studies, we initialize with a constant surface heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$) working against a constant lapse rate ($\gamma$), it would be good to see the formation of a convective boundary layer with the expected average profiles.\\

Given our concern about a slightly smaller domain than usual, we would like to make sure each of the individual cases are producing coherent turbulent structures and that there is adequate scale separation between the structures with highest energy and the grid size.\\

\citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev} showed with effective visual aids some of the details of the dynamics in the \acs{EL}.  It would be important to at least confirm our setup is producing comparable motions of warm and cool air in this region.\\  


\subsection{Local Mixed Layer Heights}

The average profiles must correspond to the average of the local profiles.  Local potential temperatures are expected to be less smooth and their variance in height corresponds to the depth of the average entrainment layer.  \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev} used a centered differencing gradient method to find the local convective boundary layer (\acs{CBL}) heights. \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} in \cite{BrooksFowler2} apply a wavelet of dilation comparable to \acs{EL} depth the to local tracer profiles to determine the location of the \acs{EL} and then a narrower wavelet to determine the limits.  Since the local profiles are not smooth, and there is often upper variabilty of similar and greater magnitude than that which separates the mixed layer (\acs{ML}) from the layer above it the gradient method is not reliable.  A typical tracer profile is quite different to a potential temperature profile IE it goes from a large value in the \acs{CBL} to a much lower value above.  So an ideal approximation might be a step function.  Usually the variation accross the \acs{EL} is much greater than any local variation.  The vertical potential temperature gradient profile in this study could be approximated by step function but there is variance usually above the \acs{EL} which is of comparable magnitude to that accross it.  So a wavelet technique might not be as well suited. \citeauthor{SteynBaldHoff} in \cite{SteynBaldHoff} fitted an idealized curve to tracer profiles (Lidar backscatter).  So we apply this idea and the multi-linear regression method outlined by \citeauthor{Vieth} in \cite{Vieth} to our local potential temperature profiles.  The result is a three line fit, one line for each of the layers IE the \acs{ML} of almost constant potentia temperature, the \acs{EL} over which transition to the stable layer above occurs, and the stable layer of constant lapse rate $\gamma$.  From
this the height of the mixed layer (\acs{ML}) can readily be determined and the distribution of local \acs{ML} heights ($h^{l}_{0}$) should correspond to the concept of the \acs{EL}.  We would expect increased stability ($\gamma$) to reduce the disortion of the inversion interface and so the variation in $h^{l}_{0}$. Increased surface heat flux ($w^{'}\theta^{'}_{s}$) would increase the overall magnitude of $h^{l}_{0}$ so histograms would represent these effects.  We would expect also the $h^{l}_{0}$ surface to correspond to coherent plumes of warm and cool air.  In particular hight $h^{l}_{0}$ should correspond to impinging cool plumes at the top of the \acs{EL}.

\subsection{Flux Quadrants}

Since the average potential temperature profile represents the results of warming, and warming occurrs via the flux of heat from below and above ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$, $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{h}$) observation and analyisis of the heat flux ($w^{'}\theta^{'}$)s should give some insight as to the shape of vertical average potential temperature profile.  For instance is there a clear trend in how the upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) influences the extent of downward moving warm air in the the \acs{EL} and so the heating rate from above of the \acs{ML}. Quadrant analyses have been carried on the fluxes from both LES output and measurement (\citeauthor{SullMoengStev}, \cite{SullMoengStev} and \citeauthor{MahrtPaum}, \cite{MahrtPaum}).  The effects of upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) on temperature and velocity perturbations in the \acs{CBL} were analyzed by \citeauthor{Sorbjan} in \cite{Sorbjan}.  Following these three studies we break the $w^{'}\theta^{'}$ into four quadrants to see the vertical average individual profiles and also the joint distributions at the \acs{EL} limits and at the inversion ($h$).  In particular to isolate the effects of $\gamma$ we will scale by the convective velocity and temperature variance scales $w^{*}$ and $\theta^{*}=\frac{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}}{w^{*}}$.

\subsection{Choice of height definitions}

Bulk models assume that the region of transition from the \acs{ML} value to the free atmospheric value in the potential temperature or buoyancy profile corresponds to the region of negative potential temperature or buoyancy flux (\citeauthor{Deardorff79} \cite{Deardorff79}, \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04}).  But although the  height of maximum average potential temperature gradient or average of local maximum potential temperature gradient used as \acs{CBL} height (\citeauthor{SullMoengStev}, \cite{SullMoengStev} and \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} \cite{GarciaMellado}) there does not seem to be an example in the literature where the \acs{EL} limits are defined in terms of the average potential temperature profile for the purpose of measurement. So here, we test this framework in terms of two scaling relationships, IE define both the \acs{CBL} height and \acs{EL} limits in terms of the average vertical potential temperature gradeient. It follows that the temperature jump ($\Delta \theta$) is defined as the difference accross the \acs{EL}.  This is 1st order type definition.  An approximation to the zero order definition would be the difference between the \acs{ML} value and the value at $h$ on the initial temperature profile.       

\subsection{$\frac{w_{e}}{w^{*}}$ vs $Ri$}

The relationship of scaled entrainment velocity to Richardson number \acs{Ri} is well established.  (\citeauthor{Deardorff79} \cite{Deardorff79} \citeauthor{DearWill80}, \cite{DearWill80}, \citeauthor{Stull-BLMetIntro} \cite{Stull-BLMetIntro}) and can be reached by first integrtating the reynolds averaged thermodynamic equation, neglecting radiation, and large scale advection, accross the inversion.  When the inversion depth is assumed infinitessimly small and there is no turbulence at the upper limit, and the flux at the lower limit is assumed a proportion of the surface flux this becomes

\begin{equation}
w_{e} \propto \frac{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}}{\Delta \theta}
\end{equation}

and scaling by the convective velocity scale gives, the following

\begin{equation}
\frac{w_{e}}{w^{*}} \propto Ri^{-1}
\end{equation}

So this relationship is based on a simplified zero order framework.  Strictly the lengthscale and $\Delta \theta$ should be from within this framework.  But we will use our 1st order framework definition to test this scaling relationship for all runs.  We will compare our $\Delta \theta$ with the zero order approximation and those defined elsewhere in the literature.  This may enable comparison with other findings, in regards to this relationship.  There is some discussion in the literature about the power exponent of the Richarson number \acs{Ri} and it seems the two major contenders are $-1$ and $-\frac{3}{2}$.  The latter has been discussed in the context of a shift in entrainment mechanism from eddy turnover to recoil at higher \acs{Ri} (\citeauthor{Turner86} \cite{Turner86}), under conditions of a large upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) \citeauthor{DearWill80} \cite{DearWill80}. \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04} asser that it is inferred when the first order $Ri$ is used IE when the temperature jump accross the \acs{EL} is used. Whereas \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} in \cite{SullMoengStev} speculate a power law other than $-1$ may apply at lower $Ri$.  We will plot our data in log-log coordinates to observe which if any power law applies to our results.

\subsection{$\frac{\Delta h}{h}$ vs $Ri$}

Relationship of the scaled \acs{EL} depth to Richardson number arises from a momentum balance where the depth is considered to be related to the overshoot of the plumes (\citeauthor{Stull73} \cite{Stull73}, \citeauthor{DearWill80} \cite{DearWill80}).  This in turn is a function of the plumes velocity at the top of the \acs{CBL} and the buoyancy difference between it and the surrounding stable air.  When the velocity at the top is assumed to be proportional the the convective velocity scale ($w^{*}$) this becomes

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta h}{h} \propto Ri^{-1}
\end{equation}

\citeauthor{Boers89} in \cite{Boers89} arrived at a $-\frac{1}{2}$ power law relationship using an energy balance.  IE they equate the difference in potential and thermal energy before and after distortion of the inversion interface to the kinetic energy before distortion. Output and measurements have resulted in power laws ranging from  $-1$ to $-\frac{1}{4}$ (\citeauthor{Traum11} \cite{Traum11}).\\

Given that our principal definition of the \acs{EL} has not been used before we would be happy to see any relationship to \acs{Ri}.  Once we establish there is one, we will use log-log coordinates to see which power law best fits.\\

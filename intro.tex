\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:}

Atmospheric boundary layer growth by entrainment driven by convecive thermals acting against a stable lapse rate
or inversion makes for an interesting topic.  (list of studies) It is a subsection of a broader topic of interest in geophysical fluid dynamics ie that of entrainment of a fluid into a turbulent fluid accross a density interface.  It involves the buoyant suppression of buoancy driven plumes, and subsequent trapping and mixing of the more buoyant air from accross the buoyancy/density gradient or jump.\\

Boundary layer height and prediction there of are important for calculating tracer IE pollutant concentrations
and the limiting sizes of turbulant structures.  (Steyn Baldi Hoff) Also the rate at which the boundary layer entrains air from above
enables calculation of the rate at which tracers transported long range are drawn in an mixed with the air we breathe.\\

In combination with the lifting condensation level, knowledge of entrainment layer depth allows predictions pertaining
to the formation of cumulous clouds for example if the \acs{EL} is above the lifting condensation a high percentage of cloud cover
would be expected.  Parametrizations for both \acs{CBL} growth and \acs{EL} depth are used in Mesoscale models and GCMs.  Further along the vein of prediction and parametrization it is an attractive goal to develop a robust set of scales such that a similarity theory as analogous to MO theory for the surface for this region could be developed (quote from GarciaMellado, Sorbjan1999).\\

Bulk analyitical models underly certain parametrizations and scaling relatiohships (Traumner) and are validated by measurements 
and output from LES and DNS models. The two important categories referenced here are the zero order whcih
assume an infinitessimly thin entrainment layer and the 1st order which includes an entrainment layer of finite depth
and there is discussion in the literature as to whether explicit consideration of the \acs{EL} depth is required. Both
types typically relies on the simplified reynolds averaged thermodynamic equation 

\begin{equation}
\frac{D \overline{\theta}}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial \overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}}{\partial z}
\end{equation}

relating average potential temperature to average vertical turbulent potential temperature flux, as well as idealized vertical profiles for both.  So verification of the resulting entrainment equation by LES using ensemble averaged $\theta$ and $w^{'}\theta^{'}$ logically follows.  So far, horizontal and time averaging has been
used but we will run an ensemble of cases, and apply true ensemble averaging as well as horizontaly averaging to get smooth vertical profiles.\\  


Studies in which the scaling relation or parametrizations for $\Delta h$ is verified (Deardorf tank, SullMoengStev, Fed, BrooksFow, GarciaMellado) refer to the potential temperature or buoyancy inversion region but do not define the entrainment layer \acs{EL} limits it in terms of the 
vertical average potential temperature profile.  So it seemed like an obvious opportunity to try.\\

Convective boundary layer entrainment depends most critically on surface heat flux and upper lapse rate (Fed04 from Sorbjan1996) 
but so far similar studies (ie those verifying the entrainment rate and entrainment layer depth relations) have focused on acheiving 
a range of Richardson numbers by varying $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ and the temperature jump (SullMoeng, BrooksFow), whereas Fedorovich varied the upper lapse rate while maintaining a constant surface heat flux.  We choose to vary these two key external parameters, allowing a $\Delta \theta$ to develop with penetrative convection and entrainment.  Garcia and mellado came out after our runs were done, but they seem to vary both. \\

Sullivan and Pattons resolution study showed the sensitivity of the heat flux and potential temperature profiles to grid size in particular in the vertical and in the entrainment layer.  This strongliy influenced our decision to apply a higher resolution within the entrainment layer than the previous similar LES studies.\\

\section{Relevant Background}
\label{sec:}
\subsection{The Convective Boundary Layer (CBL)}
idealized

over land

plumes / thermals working against stable lapse rate, and inversion strengthened by subsidence

what these plumes, updraughts and downdraughts look like, from LES and measurments (schmitschu, traum, stullcrum)

a turbulent mixed layer -- kolmagorov cascade?

local to average profiles

I can talk about measurements and model output

I can talk about an imposed strenghtened inversion by for example subsidence, as well as a jump arising
from overshoot and subsequent entrainment.

Talk about regimes in here, the equilibriium one.

Talk about the cbl in terms of potential tempertature and heat fluxes ie well mixed uniform potential temperature in
the mixed layer, transition to upper lapse rate.  warming due to heat flux from the surface, and also from the entrainment
of warmer air from aloft. mixed layer you have warm updraughts and cool downdraughts overall.  this changes at the top.
the warm thermal plumes now relatively cool, they rise impinge and sink due to exceeding their buoyancy level, so their
now is warmer downward moving air and upward cool air.

\subsection{Convective Boundary Layer Height}
\label{subsec:}

description, ie point where turbulent kinetic energy, tracer concentrations decrease, air becomes less homogenous.

definitions: from measurements from models, slip mine in here, the local one AND the average one. 

the temperature profile

measurement techniques for measurements, and models.

\subsection{Convective Boundary Layer Growth by Entrainment}
\label{subsec:}

The different regimes -- mention shear but focus on stability, use traumner, sullivan and moeng
as well as turner's review. overturn vs recoil.  trapping of pockets between plumes.  mention internal 
wavebreaking but say it hasn't been seen in studies directly comparable to ours.

\subsection{The Convective Boundary Layer Entrainment Layer}
\label{subsec:}

locally, ie horizontal 2d, to horizontal average, to idealized/model representation.

lower layer, more turbulent upper layer stability with intermittent turbulence
GarciaMellado's two layer structure makes perfect sense.

what this looks like from measurements eg lidar traum and LES sullmoeng.

how it looks in terms of temperature.  then the movement of up and down warm and cool air ie the 
fluxes.  

traumner talks about two concepts, statistical vs transition zone concept -- by the way it seems the transition zone concept
was implimented by fitting a curve of which the transition zone was a parameter.

\section{Research Goals}
\label{sec:ResearchGoals}

The LES studies of \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev}, \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04} and more recently \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} in \cite{BrooksFowler2} were carried out on grids of lower resolution than those which began to converge in \citeauthor{SullPat} \cite{SullPat}, except for the cases specifically for testing resolution effects. \citeauthor{SullPat} \cite{SullPat} influenced our choice of grid size, in particular within the \acs{EL}\\

 All of these were carried out on $5 \times 5 km$ domains and used a combination of both time and spatial averaging to obtain average profiles.  So far, we haven't seen a study involving an ensemble of cases, such that true ensemble averaging can be carried out.  We chose this setup to obtain true ensemble averages, and to have a wealth of local points for some basic statistical observations.\\

\citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04} varied their cases by upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) over a typical range found in the troposphere IE $1 - 10 K / Km$, whereas \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev} and \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} in \cite{BrooksFowler2} varied surface heat flux and initial inversion ($\Delta \theta$).  To obtain a range of Richardson numbers (\acs{Ri}) we varied both surface heat flux ($w^{'}\theta^{'}$) and upper lapse rate ($\gamma$).\\

\subsection{Verifying that the Model output is realistic}

Since unlike the other LES studies, we initialize with a constant surface heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$) working against a constant lapse rate ($\gamma$), it would be good to see the formation of a convective boundary layer with the expected average profiles.\\

Given our concern about a slightly smaller domain than usual, we would like to make sure each of the individual cases are producing coherent turbulent structures and that there is adequate scale separation between the structures with highest energy and the grid size.\\

\citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev} showed with effective visual aids some of the details of the dynamics in the \acs{EL}.  It would be important to at least confirm our setup is producing comparable motions of warm and cool air in this region.\\  


\subsection{Local Mixed Layer Heights}

The average profiles must correspond to the average of the local profiles.  Local potential temperatures are expected to be less smooth and their variance in height corresponds to the depth of the average entrainment layer.  \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} \cite{SullMoengStev} used a centered differencing gradient method to find the local convective boundary layer (\acs{CBL}) heights. \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} in \cite{BrooksFowler2} apply a wavelet of dilation comparable to \acs{EL} depth the to local tracer profiles to determine the location of the \acs{EL} and then a narrower wavelet to determine the limits.  Since the local profiles are not smooth, and there is often upper variabilty of similar and greater magnitude than that which separates the mixed layer (\acs{ML}) from the layer above it the gradient method is not reliable.  A typical tracer profile is quite different to a potential temperature profile IE it goes from a large value in the \acs{CBL} to a much lower value above.  So an ideal approximation might be a step function.  Usually the variation accross the \acs{EL} is much greater than any local variation.  The vertical potential temperature gradient profile in this study could be approximated by step function but there is variance usually above the \acs{EL} which is of comparable magnitude to that accross it.  So a wavelet technique might not be as well suited. \citeauthor{SteynBaldHoff} in \cite{SteynBaldHoff} fitted an idealized curve to tracer profiles (Lidar backscatter).  So we apply this idea and the multi-linear regression method outlined by \citeauthor{Vieth} in \cite{Vieth} to our local potential temperature profiles.  The result is a three line fit, one line for each of the layers IE the \acs{ML} of almost constant potentia temperature, the \acs{EL} over which transition to the stable layer above occurs, and the stable layer of constant lapse rate $\gamma$.  From
this the height of the mixed layer (\acs{ML}) can readily be determined and the distribution of local \acs{ML} heights ($h^{l}_{0}$) should correspond to the concept of the \acs{EL}.  We would expect increased stability ($\gamma$) to reduce the disortion of the inversion interface and so the variation in $h^{l}_{0}$. Increased surface heat flux ($w^{'}\theta^{'}_{s}$) would increase the overall magnitude of $h^{l}_{0}$ so histograms would represent these effects.  We would expect also the $h^{l}_{0}$ surface to correspond to coherent plumes of warm and cool air.  In particular hight $h^{l}_{0}$ should correspond to impinging cool plumes at the top of the \acs{EL}.

\subsection{Flux Quadrants}

Since the average potential temperature profile represents the results of warming, and warming occurrs via the flux of heat from below and above ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$, $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{h}$) observation and analyisis of the heat flux ($w^{'}\theta^{'}$)s should give some insight as to the shape of vertical average potential temperature profile.  For instance is there a clear trend in how the upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) influences the extent of downward moving warm air in the the \acs{EL} and so the heating rate from above of the \acs{ML}. Quadrant analyses have been carried on the fluxes from both LES output and measurement (\citeauthor{SullMoengStev}, \cite{SullMoengStev} and \citeauthor{MahrtPaum}, \cite{MahrtPaum}).  The effects of upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) on temperature and velocity perturbations in the \acs{CBL} were analyzed by \citeauthor{Sorbjan} in \cite{Sorbjan}.  Following these three studies we break the $w^{'}\theta^{'}$ into four quadrants to see the vertical average individual profiles and also the joint distributions at the \acs{EL} limits and at the inversion ($h$).  In particular to isolate the effects of $\gamma$ we will scale by the convective velocity and temperature variance scales $w^{*}$ and $\theta^{*}=\frac{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}}{w^{*}}$.

\subsection{Choice of height definitions}

Bulk models assume that the region of transition from the \acs{ML} value to the free atmospheric value in the potential temperature or buoyancy profile corresponds to the region of negative potential temperature or buoyancy flux (\citeauthor{Deardorff79} \cite{Deardorff79}, \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04}).  But although the  height of maximum average potential temperature gradient or average of local maximum potential temperature gradient used as \acs{CBL} height (\citeauthor{SullMoengStev}, \cite{SullMoengStev} and \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} \cite{GarciaMellado}) there does not seem to be an example in the literature where the \acs{EL} limits are defined in terms of the average potential temperature profile for the purpose of measurement. So here, we test this framework in terms of two scaling relationships, IE define both the \acs{CBL} height and \acs{EL} limits in terms of the average vertical potential temperature gradeient. It follows that the temperature jump ($\Delta \theta$) is defined as the difference accross the \acs{EL}.  This is 1st order type definition.  An approximation to the zero order definition would be the difference between the \acs{ML} value and the value at $h$ on the initial temperature profile.       

\subsection{$\frac{w_{e}}{w^{*}}$ vs $Ri$}

The relationship of scaled entrainment velocity to Richardson number \acs{Ri} is well established.  (\citeauthor{Deardorff79} \cite{Deardorff79} \citeauthor{DearWill80}, \cite{DearWill80}, \citeauthor{Stull-BLMetIntro} \cite{Stull-BLMetIntro}) and can be reached by first integrtating the reynolds averaged thermodynamic equation, neglecting radiation, and large scale advection, accross the inversion.  When the inversion depth is assumed infinitessimly small and there is no turbulence at the upper limit, and the flux at the lower limit is assumed a proportion of the surface flux this becomes

\begin{equation}
w_{e} \propto \frac{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}}{\Delta \theta}
\end{equation}

and scaling by the convective velocity scale gives, the following

\begin{equation}
\frac{w_{e}}{w^{*}} \propto Ri^{-1}
\end{equation}

So this relationship is based on a simplified zero order framework.  Strictly the lengthscale and $\Delta \theta$ should be from within this framework.  But we will use our 1st order framework definition to test this scaling relationship for all runs.  We will compare our $\Delta \theta$ with the zero order approximation and those defined elsewhere in the literature.  This may enable comparison with other findings, in regards to this relationship.  There is some discussion in the literature about the power exponent of the Richarson number \acs{Ri} and it seems the two major contenders are $-1$ and $-\frac{3}{2}$.  The latter has been discussed in the context of a shift in entrainment mechanism from eddy turnover to recoil at higher \acs{Ri} (\citeauthor{Turner86} \cite{Turner86}), under conditions of a large upper lapse rate ($\gamma$) \citeauthor{DearWill80} \cite{DearWill80}. \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} \cite{FedConzMir04} asser that it is inferred when the first order $Ri$ is used IE when the temperature jump accross the \acs{EL} is used. Whereas \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} in \cite{SullMoengStev} speculate a power law other than $-1$ may apply at lower $Ri$.  We will plot our data in log-log coordinates to observe which if any power law applies to our results.

\subsection{$\frac{\Delta h}{h}$ vs $Ri$}

Relationship of the scaled \acs{EL} depth to Richardson number arises from a momentum balance where the depth is considered to be related to the overshoot of the plumes (\citeauthor{Stull73} \cite{Stull73}, \citeauthor{DearWill80} \cite{DearWill80}).  This in turn is a function of the plumes velocity at the top of the \acs{CBL} and the buoyancy difference between it and the surrounding stable air.  When the velocity at the top is assumed to be proportional the the convective velocity scale ($w^{*}$) this becomes

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta h}{h} \propto Ri^{-1}
\end{equation}

\citeauthor{Boers89} in \cite{Boers89} arrived at a $-\frac{1}{2}$ power law relationship using an energy balance.  IE they equate the difference in potential and thermal energy before and after distortion of the inversion interface to the kinetic energy before distortion. Output and measurements have resulted in power laws ranging from  $-1$ to $-\frac{1}{4}$ (\citeauthor{Traum11} \cite{Traum11}).\\

Given that our principal definition of the \acs{EL} has not been used before we would be happy to see any relationship to \acs{Ri}.  Once we establish there is one, we will use log-log coordinates to see which power law best fits.\\

%seems to be excellent.
%The source code for this docment, however, is intended to serve as
%an example for creating a \LaTeX\ version of your dissertation.

%We start by discussing organizational issues, such as splitting

%This template reflects that arrangement.

%In terms of writing your thesis, the recommended best practice for
%organizing large documents in \LaTeX\ is to place each chapter in
%a separate file.  These chapters are then included from the main
%file through the use of \verb+\include{file}+.  A thesis might
%be described as six files such as \file{intro.tex},
%\file{relwork.tex}, \file{model.tex}, \file{eval.tex},
%\file{discuss.tex}, and \file{concl.tex}.

%We also encourage you to use macros for separating how something
%will be typeset (\eg bold, or italics) from the meaning of that
%something. 
%For example, if you look at \file{intro.tex}, you will see repeated
%uses of a macro \verb+\file{}+ to indicate file names.
%The \verb+\file{}+ macro is defined in the file \file{macros.tex}.
%The consistent use of \verb+\file{}+ throughout the text not only
%indicates that the argument to the macro represents a file (providing
%meaning or semantics), but also allows easily changing how
%file names are typeset simply by changing the definition of the
%\verb+\file{}+ macro.
%\file{macros.tex} contains other useful macros for properly typesetting
%things like the proper uses of the latinate \emph{exempli grati\={a}}

%web references with a footnoted \acs{URL} (\verb+\webref{url}{text}+),
%as well as definitions specific to this documentation

%makes it easier still. 

%A thing to be cross-referenced, such as a section, figure, or equation,
%is \emph{labelled} using a unique, user-provided identifier, defined

%The thing is referenced elsewhere using the \verb+\autoref{}+ command.
%For example, this section was defined using:
%\begin{lstlisting}

%References to this section are made as follows:
%\begin{lstlisting}
 %   We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\

%\verb+\autoref{}+ takes care of determining the \emph{type} of the

%The label is any simple sequence of characters, numbers, digits,

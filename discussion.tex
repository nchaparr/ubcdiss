\subsection{Significance of Grid-size}

\citeauthor{SullPat} (\citeyear{SullPat}) found that the shapes of the average potential temperature ($\overline{\theta}$) and heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$) profiles, as well as the measured \acs{CBL} height vary depending on grid size.  The resolution at which convergence begins is listed in Table \ref{table:gridcomp}.  At lower resolution the $\overline{\theta}$ and $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profiles are such that the entrainment zone (\acs{EZ}) is a larger portion of the \acs{CBL} and measured \acs{CBL} height is higher.  Overall they concluded that vertical resolution was critical.  This compliments the conclusion \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) reached when discussing their resolution test.  That is, to capture the steep vertical gradients in the \acs{EZ} requires high vertical resolution. \\

As \citeauthor{Turner86} discusses in his \citeyear{Turner86} review of turbulent entrainment, smaller scale processes such as those at the molecular level are relatively unimportant.  Large scale engulfment and trapping between thermals dominates.  If the ergodic assumption is applied and $\overline{\theta^{'2}}$ is calculated based on the difference at a point from the horizontal average, it is a measure of horizontal variance at a point in time.  \citeauthor{SullPat} (\citeyear{SullPat}) found that the vertical distance over which $\overline{\theta^{'2}}$, calculate in this way, varied significantly more or less converged at the resolution shown in Table \ref{table:gridcomp}.  But the maximum continued to increase up to their finest grid spacing (5, 5, 2).\\

The question as to whether mixing and gradients within the \acs{EZ} are adequately resolved serves as motivation for \acs{DNS}  studies such as that of \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}). These authors found the entrainment ratio $\frac{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{z_{f}}}{\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}}$ to be about 0.1 which is lower than what \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) observed, but close to what was seen here in Figures \ref{fig:fluxprofs2hrs} and \ref{fig:tempgradfluxprofs1005}.  Based on their $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profiles the depth of the region of negative flux is comparable to what's shown in Figure \ref{fig:scaledELlims}.  Furthermore, these author's concluded that the production and destruction rates of \acs{TKE}, as well as the entrainment ratio used to calculate the entrainment rate, were effectively independent of molecular scale processes.\\  
  
The \acs{FFT} energy spectra of the turbulent velocities at the top of the \acs{ML} show a substantial resolved inertial subrange giving confidence in the choice of horizontal grid size used. In the \acs{EZ} where turbulence is intermittent, the dominant energy containing structures are smaller, and decay to the smallest resolved turbulent structures is steeper. This confirms the assertion of \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) that the \acs{EZ} is separated into two sub-layers in terms of turbulence scales.\\

\subsection{Horizontal Domain}

The horizontal domain in this study is relatively small (see Table \ref{table:gridcomp}). However, visualizations of horizontal and vertical slices clearly showed multiple resolved thermals.  Their diameters increased with \acs{CBL} height, but remained less than or on the order of 100 meters.  \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) carried out one run on a smaller domain with higher resolution, noticed it resulted in lower \acs{CBL} height and concluded this was due to restricted horizontal thermal size. However, given the results of \citeauthor{SullPat} (\citeyear{SullPat}) it could have been an effect of grid-size.\\   

\citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) encountered significant scatter when basing heights of average profiles.  \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev})'s heights based on average profiles produced jagged, oscillating time-series. But the heights based on average profiles here, using an ensemble of cases, varied smoothly in time.  This could be attributed to a smoother profile based on a greater number horizontal points (10*128*192).\\

\subsection{Initial Conditions}

The principle parameter describing the balance of forces in dry, idealized \acs{CBL} entrainment is the Richardson number $\acs{Ri}$ and its magnitude depends on the way in which the $\theta$ jump is defined.  Varying this can cause identical conditions to be described by quite different $\acs{Ri}$s.  The $\acs{Ri}$ range in this study was dependent on variation in $\gamma$ and less so on 
$\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$.  \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) and \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) imposed a $\theta$ jump of varying strength topped by a constant $\gamma$.  Whereas \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) initialized with a layer of uniform $\theta$, topped by a constant $\gamma$ and a constant heat flux.  They varied $\gamma$ and kept $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ constant for each run.  Their initial conditions, definitions of the $\theta$ jump and $\acs{Ri}$ range are directly comparable to those of this study, whereas those of \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) and \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) are quite different.\\

\section{Local \acs{CBL} Heights and turbulent Fluctuations}

\subsection{The Gradient Method is problematic}

\citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) determined local \acs{CBL} height by locating the point of maximum gradient.  Analysis of the resulting distributions showed dependence of standard deviation and skewness on Richardson number ($\acs{Ri}$).  The normalized standard deviation decreased with increased \acs{Ri} whereas skewness was almost bimodal; being negative at high $\acs{Ri}$ and positive and low \acs{Ri}.  Initially in this study, I applied a similar method and found distributions with lower $\acs{Ri}$ to have positive skew.  Upon exhaustive inspection of local vertical $\theta$  profiles, it became evident that at certain horizontal points high gradients well into the free atmosphere exceeded those closer to the location of the \acs{CBL} height reasonably identified by eye.\\

\subsection{Local \acs{ML} Height Distributions}

Locating the local \acs{ML} height ($h^{l}_{0}$) using the multi-linear regression method described in Chapter 2 proved more reliable.  The resulting distributions, normalized by \acs{CBL} height ($h$),  showed a decrease in the lowest $\frac{h^{l}_{0}}{h}$ resulting in an apparent increased negative skew with decreasing stability (decreasing $\acs{Ri}$). This combined with an increase in spread agrees with the findings \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) and supports the results based on the average profiles in Section \ref{sec:deltahri}.  The approximate scaled \acs{EZ} based on the $\frac{h^{l}_{0}}{h}$ distributions is about 0.2 - 0.4 whereas that based on distributions of local maximum tracer gradients by  \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) was smaller (.05 - .2).  But the local maximum gradient of the tracer profile would likely be within the \acs{EZ} at points outside an actively impinging plume and so higher than $h^{l}_{0}$ defined here. \\  

%Potential temperature and vertical velocity fluctuations ($\theta^{'}$ and $w^{'}$) at several vertical levels around the \acs{EL} were plotted as 2 dimensional histograms.  Increased $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ causes an increase in positive temperature fluctuations and verical velocity as thermals become more vigorous, causing a higher $h$ so and a deeper \acs{EZ} over which relatively warmer air is pulled down.  The convective velocity scales ($\theta^{*}$ and $w^{*}$) were appplied to isolate the effects of $\gamma$, although it is accounted for indirectly via $h$ (see Section \ref{subsec:scales}). As shown in \citeauthor{Sorbjan}'s (\citeyear{Sorbjan}) $\theta^{'}$ is influenced  by $\gamma$.  For example at $h$ there is an apparant increase in the spread, as well as a shift thowards the positive.  So downward moving positive potential temperature fluctuations representing air from the \acs{FA} are more positive and negative fluctuations representing thermals are less negative, when scaled.  The former can easily be attributed to relatively warmer air over a shorter vertical distance (\acs{EZ}) being brought down but an explaination for the latter remains elusive.  I conclude that with incresed $\gamma$ there is a positive deviation from the convective temperature scale.  Also, there is an apparant damping of the scaled velocities associated with positive temperature fluctuations.  So the $w^{*}$ scales these less effectively with increased $\gamma$.  \\

\subsection{Local vertical Velocity and Potential Temperature Fluctuations}

As expected, with increased $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ the variance and magnitude of the vertical velocity fluctuations within and at the limits of the \acs{EZ} increase.  Greater turbulent velocity causes a higher \acs{CBL} and a deeper \acs{EZ} over which; relatively warmer air from higher up is brought down, and relatively cooler air from below is brought up.  So the magnitude and spread of the potential temperature fluctuations ($\theta^{'}$) increase. All of this agrees with the findings of \citeauthor{Sorbjan} (\citeyear{Sorbjan}), but the portion of the scaled $w^{'}$ ($\frac{w^{'}}{w^{*}}$) distribution where scaled $\theta^{'}$ ($\frac{\theta^{'}}{\theta^{*}}$) is positive, in Figure \ref{fig:scaled_fluxquadsh1}, appears to narrow as $\gamma$ increases. This contradicts his assertion that velocities are uninfluenced by this parameter while the effectiveness of $w^{*}$ as a scale for $w^{'-}$ where $\theta^{'}>0$ in Figure \ref{fig:downwarm} supports it.\\

\subsection{Downward moving warm Air at $h$}

 Although the motion of the thermals dominates within the \acs{EZ}, the $\overline{w^{'-}\theta^{'-}}$, $\overline{w^{'+}\theta^{'-}}$ and $\overline{w^{'-}\theta^{'+}}$ quadrants do approximately cancel leaving $\overline{w^{'-}\theta^{'+}}$ as the net dynamic, as \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) concluded. The downward moving warm quadrant at $h$ ($\overline{w^{'-}\theta^{'+}}_{h}$) represents warmer free atmosphere (\acs{FA}) air that is being entrained.  So its magnitude, at a certain point in time, is an indication of how much the region below will be warmed due to entrainment at a successive time.  The increase of $\overline{w^{'-}\theta^{'+}}_{h}$ in time is primarily due to the increased average positive potential temperature fluctuation at $h$ ($\overline{\theta^{'+}}_{h}$) which is effectively scaled by the temperature scale $(h_{1}-h)\gamma$.  A similar scale was introduced by \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) to further their line of reasoning that the buoyancy in the upper \acs{EZ} is determined by $\gamma$. Figure \ref{fig:deltagamma} illustrates a broad qualitative explanation.  At $h$ much of the air is at the background (or initial) potential temperature $\overline{\theta}_{0}(h)$. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption[Illustration of \acs{EZ} Potential Temperature Scale based on $\gamma$]{Illustration of the potential temperature scale $(h_{1}-h)\gamma = \delta \gamma$: The curves represent a vertical cross-section of thermal tops.  Between them is stable air at the initial lapse rate $\gamma$. $h_{1}$ and $h$ correspond to the highest and average thermal height respectively and $h_{0}$ is the top of the well mixed region (\acs{ML}).  The horizontally uniform, initial potential temperature is $\theta_{0} = \overline{\theta}_{0}$. A thermal will initiate the downward movement of air from $h_{1}$ to $h$, and the difference between its potential temperature and that of the background stable air at $h$ is $(h_{1}-h)\gamma = \delta \gamma$.}

\end{figure}
%diagram with plumes and as and $\gamma$

Some air at potential temperature $\theta = \overline{\theta}_{0}(h_{1})$ is brought down from the upper \acs{EZ} limit ($h_{1}$) resulting in positive potential temperature fluctuations ($\theta^{'+}$) at $h$.\\

\citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) suggest that the buoyancy in the lower portion of the \acs{EZ}, i.e. from a point just below $h$ down, is more strongly influenced by the vigorous turbulence of the \acs{ML} than by $\gamma$.  So mixing reduces the difference between, the temperature at the top of the \acs{ML}, and that at or just below $h$.  However the observation in Section \ref{subsec:ellimscaledprof}, that the magnitude of the average vertical potential temperature gradient (\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}) in the upper \acs{ML} increases with increasing $\gamma$, indicates that the influence of this parameter extends further.  On a related note, the magnitude of the minimum $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ is seen to increase with increased $\gamma$, here and in both \citeauthor{Sorbjan}'s (\citeyear{Sorbjan}) and \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}).  It is reasonable to suggest this leads to an increased $-\frac{\partial \overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}}{\partial z}$ in the lower \acs{EZ} and so increased warming per Equation \ref{eq:warming}.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}} \tag{\ref{eq:warming1}}
\end{equation}

\section{Relationship of Entrainment Zone Depth to Richardson Number ($\acs{Ri}$)}

The \acs{EZ} is inhomogeneous, but on average is a region of transition as clearly represented by the $\overline{\theta}$ profile.  It's where relatively cooler thermals overturn or recoil initiating entrainment as represented by the heat flux profile.  The $\overline{\theta}$ profile partially characterizes the thermodynamic state of the \acs{CBL} as well defining its three layer structure.  It is directly comparable to both bulk models and local $\theta$ profiles which in turn are comparable to a sounding, unlike a heat flux profile which is an inherently average quantity.\\

\subsection{Direct Comparison based on the Heat Flux Profile}

Neither of the two comparable \acs{LES} studies in Table \ref{table:el} define the \acs{EL} based on the $\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}$ profile.  So, to enable direct comparison heights were based on the heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$) profile as in Figure \ref{fig:hdefs1}.  In this framework \citeauthor{FedConzMir04}'s (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) show decreasing scaled \acs{EZ} with increasing $\acs{Ri }$ (decreasing $\acs{Ri}^{-1}$) and conclude an exponent of of $b = -\frac{1}{2}$.  They attribute the decrease in the overall scaled depth to a slight decrease in the scaled top limit over time.  However based on their plot the decrease seems more than what I would call slight, varying from about 0.5 to 0.2.\\

Heights are as based on the $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profile as in Figure \ref{fig:hdefs1}, their $z_{i}$ is my $z_{f}$. $Ri_{\Delta b}$ (circles) and $Ri_{\delta b}$ (crosses) correspond directly to those determined here using $\delta \theta$ and $\Delta \theta$.  Note their $\Delta$ refers to the smaller $\theta$ jump, be that at $z_{f}$, whereas I use it for the larger.  $Ri_{N}$ (triangles) is the Richardson number defined in Equation \ref{eq:gradri}, with $w^{*}$ and $z_{f}$ as the velocity and length scale.}
    \label{fig:FedEZRi}   % label should change
\end{figure}


 \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) found no clear$\acs{Ri}$ dependence of the scaled \acs{EZ} depth based on the $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profile.  But their definition was based on the lower part ($z_{f1} - z_{f}$) which according to \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) does not vary in time.  Figure \ref{fig:deltahinvri_scaled} of this thesis shows that when based on the $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profile per \citeauthor{FedConzMir04}'s (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}), the scaled \acs{EZ} depth no clear dependence on$\acs{Ri}$. This is supported by the similarity in time and across runs of the vertical turbulent heat flux profiles when scaled by $(\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}})_{s}$ in Figures \ref{fig:scaledfluxprofs15010} and \ref{fig:fluxprofs2hrs}.\\

The most obvious possible cause for this disagreement with the results of \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04})is the difference in grid size shown in Table \ref{table:gridcomp}.  Inspection of their $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profiles confirms a relatively deeper region of negative flux as compared with those seen here (~.4 vs ~.25). Their surface heat flux $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ was twice the highest used here, but their range of $\acs{Ri}$ is comparable to that of this study.  The latter point although not directly relevant here, serves as confirmation that $\gamma$ is the more influential parameter.\\

\subsection{General Comparison using the Potential Temperature Profile}

Here, when heights are defined on the scaled vertical potential temperature gradient profile $\frac{\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}}{\gamma}$ the curve representing Equation \ref{eq:dhvsri} 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta h}{h} \propto Ri^{b} \tag{\ref{eq:dhvsri}}
\end{equation}

shows an exponent $b$ which increases in magnitude, from about $-\frac{1}{2}$ as predicted and seen by \citeauthor{Boers89} (\citeyear{Boers89}), to about $-1$ as justified in \citeauthor{StullNelEl} (\citeyear{StullNelEl}),  with increasing $\acs{Ri}$ (decreasing $\acs{Ri}^{-1}$).  Overall there is a clear narrowing of the scaled \acs{EZ} depth with increased$\acs{Ri}$ (decreased $\acs{Ri}^{-1}$) as supported by the local height distributions in Section \ref{subsec:locmlh}.  Although using on different height definitions \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) concluded an exponent $b = -\frac{1}{2}$ and \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2}'s (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) plots show curves with an apparent exponent less in magnitude than $-1$, in Figure \ref{fig:BandFEZ}. \\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    %plot_height.py[master 1573b9d] h vs time plot

Their $\theta$ jump is an average of the potential temperature differences across the local \acs{EZ} depths.}
    \label{fig:BandFEZ}   % label should change
\end{figure}

The curves in Figure \ref{fig:BandFEZ} seem to separate out for each run.  In this study, before scaling the $\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}$ profile curves in Figure \ref{fig:scaledeltahinvri} separate out, but in the reverse order.  The \acs{CBL}s under higher stability have larger scaled \acs{EZ} depths.  \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2})'s runs with initially lower$\acs{Ri}$ have larger scaled \acs{EZ} depths than those with higher, even where$\acs{Ri}$ values overlap.\\     

Neither study referenced in Table \ref{table:el} addresses a change in exponent with increased $\acs{Ri}$ that I observe in Figure \ref{fig:loglogdeltahinvri}.  It is reasonable to suggest that this represents a change in entrainment mechanism. \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) observed enfolding and engulfment at lower$\acs{Ri}$.  Whereas at higher$\acs{Ri}$ when motion is more restricted, entrainment seemed to occur via trapping of thinner wisps at the edge of an upward moving thermal.  \citeauthor{Turner86} (\citeyear{Turner86}) also distinguishes between entrainment by convective overturning and recoil. \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) refer to a change in entrainment rate due to the effects of increased stability on the upper \acs{EZ} sub-layer.  In this study, the narrowing of the \acs{EZ} as defined here depends predominantly on the magnitude of the potential temperature gradient in the lower \acs{EZ} and upper \acs{ML}.  But the scaled magnitude of upper limit based on $\frac{\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}}{\gamma}$ does appear to decrease slightly in time.  This could correspond to the slowly decreasing upper sub layer of the \acs{EZ} mentioned in both \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) and \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}).\\

\section{Relationship of Entrainment Rate to Richardson Number}

The ranges of$\acs{Ri}$ number magnitude determined in this and the comparable studies are primarily influenced by the magnitude of the $\theta$ jump. Using different definitions, the same conditions are represented by different$\acs{Ri}$ values. Here, I define it in two ways as both \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) and \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) did.  I do this based on the $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$ profile, as in Figure \ref{fig:hdefs1} and Table \ref{table:reldefs} for the purpose of direct comparison with these studies and to observe how the change in definition effects Equation \ref{eq:ervsri}.\\

\begin{equation}
\frac{w_{e}}{w^{*}} \propto Ri^{a} \tag{\ref{eq:ervsri}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Direct Comparison based on the Heat Flux Profile}
The larger jump, i.e. that taken across the \acs{EZ} ($\Delta \theta$), yields a larger value of $a$ as \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) conclude.  \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}) interpret both curves as asymptotic to straight lines ($a=-1$) as the upper \acs{EZ} sub-layer narrows. Based on their plots in Figure \ref{fig:GarcMelERRi}, in the absence of their justification based on the derivation of the entrainment relation, for $\Delta \theta$ I see a curve with increasing exponent exceeding magnitude $-1$ at higher $\acs{Ri}$.  For $\delta \theta$ I see a curve with exponent less in magnitude than $-1$.\\

The grey and blue curve is based on $\Delta \theta$ and the (grey and) red curve is based on $\overline{\theta}(h) - \overline{\theta}_{0}(h)$ which is slightly different to the smaller jump ($\delta \theta$) defined here and in \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}). The dashed and continuous black lines represent the straight lines two which the curves asymptote according to their analysis. Their heights are comparable to those based on the heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$) profile in Figure \ref{fig:hdefs1}.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Extending Comparison to the average Potential Temperature Profile}

There is an analogous distinction between curves representing Equation \ref{eq:ervsri} using $\Delta \theta$ and those using $\delta \theta$, when all heights are based on the $\frac{\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}}{\gamma}$ profile.  So this height definition framework is valid.  Scatter is least when the $\theta$ jump is defined across the \acs{EZ}.  In Figure \ref{fig:weinvri} $-\frac{3}{2}$ fits at higher$\acs{Ri}$ (lower$\acs{Ri}$$^{-1}$) and $-1$ seems to fit at lower$\acs{Ri}$.  Combined with the apparent change in $b$ for Equation \ref{eq:dhvsri} I interpret this as an indication of a change in entrainment regime at increased$\acs{Ri}$.\\ 

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{\acs{CBL} Height and \acs{EZ} Depth can be defined based on the average Potential Temperature Profile}

This $\overline{\theta}$ profile serves to characterize the \acs{CBL} and links bulk models to soundings via an \acs{LES}.  Both the \acs{EZ} depth and \acs{CBL} height based on the average $\frac{\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}}{\gamma}$ profile show dependence on $\acs{Ri}$ as seen in other studies and justified theoretically.  So this is a valid way of defining the \acs{CBL} and its \acs{EZ}.  A change in entrainment mechanism or regime with increased $\acs{Ri}$ has been, observed in measurement as well as \acs{LES} based studies, and is justified theoretically. I suggest the change in the exponents of Equations \ref{eq:dhvsri} and \ref{eq:ervsri}, seen here, represent this.\\

\subsection{Upper Lapse-rate strongly influences dry, idealized \acs{CBL} Entrainment}

The magnitude and variance, of local height, increase with increasing $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ and decrease with increasing $\gamma$.  The same can be said for the vertical velocity fluctuations ($w^{'}$) in the \acs{EZ}.  However, increased $\gamma$ results in an increase in the positive temperature fluctuations at $h$. The magnitude of these positive temperature perturbations ($\theta^{'+}$) at points where $w^{'}$ is negative represents downward moving entrained air and depend on $\gamma$.  Below $h$, in the lower \acs{EZ}, the average vertical potential temperature gradient ($\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}$) also depends $\gamma$. So, the growth of the idealized dry \acs{CBL} is driven by $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ and suppressed by stability ($\gamma$). But warming is due, in part, to the entrainment of air from aloft the potential temperature of which in turn depends on $\gamma$.\\

Throughout this study threads the influence of $\gamma$.  Distributions of scaled local \acs{ML} heights approach apparent similarity, when $\gamma$ is constant but $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ is varied.  Curves representing Equation \ref{eq:dhvsri} group according to $\gamma$ when based on the $\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}$ profile, but become similar once based on $\frac{\frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z}}{\gamma}$.  The convective time scale $\tau = \frac{w^{*}}{h}$ and $\acs{Ri}$ group according to this parameter.  This lends support to \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04})'s use of a the Brunt-Vaisala time scale, as well as a constant heat flux with varying lapse rate.  It seems that once the effects of $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}_{s}$ are accounted for through $h$, $\gamma$ remains the dominant parameter in dry, idealized \acs{CBL} entrainment.\\

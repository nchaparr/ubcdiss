\section{Comparison of general Set-up}
\FloatBarrier

\citeauthor{SullPat} (\citeyear{SullPat}) found that the shapes of the vertical average potential temperature ($\overline{\theta}$) and average vertical heat flux ($\overline{w^{'}}\theta^{'}$) profiles, as well as the measured \acs{CBL} height vary depending on grid size.  The resolution at which convergence begins is listed in Table \ref{table:gridcomp}.  Untill this point the $\overline{\theta}$ and $\overline{w^{'}}\theta^{'}$ profiles are such that the \acs{EL} is a larger portion of the \acs{CBL} and measured \acs{CBL} height is higher overall.  Overall they concluded that vertical resolution was more critical.  This compliments the conclusion \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) when discussing their resolution test.  That is, to capture the steep vertical gradients in the \acs{EL} requires high resolution.\\

The \acs{FFT} energy spectra of horizontal slices at the top of the \acs{ML} show a substantial resolved intertial subrange giving confidence in the choice of horizontal grid size used here. In the \acs{EL} where turbulence is intermittent, the dominant energy containing structures are smaller, and decay to the grid-size is steeper.\\

As \citeauthor{Turner86} discusses in his \citeyear{Turner86} review of turbulent entrainment, the important of smaller scale processes, ie at the molecular level are relatively unimportant.  Large scale engulfment and trapping between thermals dominates. Yet, the steep vertical, and surely horizontal, gradients within the \acs{EL} remain motivational for \acs{DNS} studies such as \citeauthor{GarciaMellado} (\citeyear{GarciaMellado}).  Among these author's conclusions was that the production and destruction rates of \acs{TKE}, as well as the entrainment ratio used to calculate the entrainment rate, were effectively independent of molecular scale processes.\\  

The horizontal domain in this study is smaller than those used in the other studies listed in Table \ref{table:gridcomp}. \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) carried out one run on a smaller domain with higher resolution, noticed it resulted in lower \acs{CBL} height and concluded this was due to restricted plume size. However, given the results of \citeauthor{SullPat} (\citeyear{SullPat}) it could have been an effect of the grid.  Visualizations of horizontal and vertical slices clearly showed multiple thermals with diameter increasing with increased \acs{CBL} height, but remaining less than or on the order of 100 meters.\\   

A comparison of how the \acs{Ri}s were calculated will be left for a later section, but the range was dependent on variation in $\gamma$ and less so on $\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'}}$.  \citeauthor{BrooksFowler2} (\citeyear{BrooksFowler2}) and \citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) imposed a $\theta$ jump of varying strength topped by a constant $\gamma$.  Whereas \citeauthor{FedConzMir04} (\citeyear{FedConzMir04}) initialized with a layer of uniform $\theta$ topped by a constant $\gamma$ which was different for each run.\\

\section{Local \acs{ML} heights}

\citeauthor{SullMoengStev} (\citeyear{SullMoengStev}) determined local \acs{CBL} height by locating the point of maximum gradient.  Analysis of the resulting distributions showed dependence of standard deviation and skewness on Richardson number.  The normalized standard deviation decreased with increased \acs{Ri} whereas skewness was alomost bimodal; being negative at high \acs{Ri} and positive and low \acs{Ri}.  Iniatially in this study, I applied a similar method and found distributions with lower \acs{Ri} to have positive skew.  Upon exhaustive inspection of local vertical $\theta$  profiles, it became evident that at certain horizontal points high gradients well into the free atmposphere exceded those closer to the location of the \acs{CBL} height reasonably identified by eye.\\

Locating the \acs{ML} height using the multi-linear regression method employed proved more reliable, based on inspection of hundreds of local vertical $\theta$  profiles.  For a large proportion of these profiles it was impossible even by eye to locate a reliable \acs{CBL} height based on a maximum in the vertical gradient. The distributions were seen to broaden with increased $ (\overline{w^{'}\theta^{'})_{s} $ and narrow with increased $ \gamma $.  When normalized by the height of the maximum average vertical potential gradient ($h$) what apparantly remains is the effect of $\gamma$ on the lower limit or lowest percentile.  The result is an overall narrowing of the scaled distributions with $\gamma$.\\  

Potential temperature and vertical velocity fluctuations ($\theta^{'}$ and $w^{'}$) at several vertical levels around the \acs{EL} were plotted as 2 dimensional histograms.  At $z_{f}$ and $h$, ie within the \acs{EL} the quadrants of largest magnitude were upward and downward moving relatively cool, thermal,  air ($w^{'-}\theta^{'+}$ and $w^{'+}\theta^{'+}$). The $w^{'-}\theta^{'-}$, $w^{'+}\theta^{'-}$ and $w^{'-}\theta^{'+}$ quadrants do approximately cancel.  The convective velocity scales ($\theta^{*}$ and $w^{*}$) were appplied to isolate the effects of $\gamma$, although it is accounted for indirectly via $h$ (see Section \ref{subsec:scales}). As shown in \citeauthor{Sorbjan}'s (\citeyear{Sorbjan}) conclusion that $\theta^{'}$ is influenced  by $\gamma$.  For example at $h$ there is an apparant increase in the spread, as well as a shift thowards the positive.  So positive fluctuations due representing air from the \acs{FA} are more positive and negative fluctuations representing thermals are less negative.  The former can easily be explained in terms of an increased lapse rate above ($\gamma$).
